        <p class="p1">My name is <strong>Jadyn</strong> I am a student at Clark studying web development!!</p>
        <p class="p3">This is my 2nd year here and I plan to continue onto the cybersecurity program after! This is something
            I find super interesting and am excited to study. To help prepare myself for this I have been working through the
            CS50 cybersecurity course and I am currently half way through it! I feel so much more prepared to start the program.
            Coming into even the Web Dev program I knew nothing about computers or programming! </p>
